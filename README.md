# Ten_Armed_Bandits
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various bandit learning algorithms to solve the k-armed bandit problem. The algorithms include:

Greedy with non-optimistic initial values.
Epsilon-greedy with various epsilon values.
Optimistic initial values with a greedy approach.
Gradient bandit algorithm with different learning rates.
Requirements
