# Ten_Armed_Bandits
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various bandit learning algorithms to solve the k-armed bandit problem. The algorithms include:

Greedy with non-optimistic initial values.

Epsilon-greedy with various epsilon values.

Optimistic initial values with a greedy approach.

Gradient bandit algorithm with different learning rates.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy

Matplotlib

# Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

bash
# Usage
Run the main script to execute the bandit algorithms and generate the plots:

# Structure
main.py: The main script that runs the experiments and generates plots.
bandit_algorithms.py: Contains the implementation of the bandit algorithms.
utils.py: Utility functions for plotting and data generation.
README.md: This documentation file.

# Results
The results of the experiments, including the average accumulated reward and the proportion of optimal actions over time, are saved as plots in the results directory.
